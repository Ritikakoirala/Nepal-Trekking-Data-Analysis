# 🏔️ Trekking Data Analytics Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing trekking and travel-related data to extract meaningful insights for decision-making.  
The workflow includes **data cleaning**, **database integration using PostgreSQL**, and **interactive dashboard creation using Power BI**.

The dashboard helps users understand trekking costs, duration, altitude, trip difficulty, and seasonal travel patterns.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning
- Removed missing and inconsistent values
- Standardized column names and data formats
- Converted duration into numerical form (`Time_Days`)
- Ensured cost and altitude fields were numeric and valid
- Prepared clean, analysis-ready data

## 🗄️ Database Integration (PostgreSQL)
- Created a PostgreSQL database
- Imported cleaned data into PostgreSQL
- Connected PostgreSQL 

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard
The Power BI dashboard provides interactive and visual insights, including:

### 📈 Visualizations
- Cost comparison by trek
- Trek duration analysis
- Best travel time analysis
- Accommodation type distribution

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** – Data cleaning & preprocessing
- **PostgreSQL** – Data storage & querying
- **Power BI** – Data visualization & dashboard design

## 🎯 Key Insights
- High-altitude treks generally have higher costs
- Most treks fall under moderate difficulty
- Certain seasons are more popular for trekking
- Average trek duration ranges within a manageable timeframe
